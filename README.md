ðŸš€ Passionate Web Developer | Frontend & Backend Expertise ðŸ’»

I specialize in creating interactive, responsive, and fully functional websites from the ground up. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I bring designs to life with clean, user-friendly interfaces. On the backend, I build powerful, secure, and efficient server-side applications using PHP and MySQL.

Whether it's designing sleek frontends or developing solid backends, I use tools like VS Code for streamlined development and XAMPP to simulate real-world environments locally â€” ensuring every project runs smoothly from start to finish.

âœ¨ What I Work With:

Frontend: HTML | CSS | JavaScript

Backend: PHP | MySQL

Tools: VS Code | XAMPP
